const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'Is Premarket free for buyers?',
    a: "Yes — completely free, forever. We make money from real estate agents who run campaigns on the platform. Buyers and buyer's agents never pay a cent.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I list my own home as a vendor?',
    a: "Premarket is agent-led on purpose. The right path is to ask your local real estate agent about a Premarket campaign — they'll run the campaign for you. If you don't have an agent yet, our team can help you find one in your area.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Will my home appear on realestate.com.au or Domain?',
    a: "Only if you choose. Premarket campaigns can stay completely private — visible only to qualified buyers and buyer's agents on the platform. You decide when (and if) you go public.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does it cost an agent to list a property?',
    a: "Agents pay a small per-campaign fee — currently $200 AUD per listing. There's no subscription, no monthly minimum, and buyers and buyer's agents are completely free.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's a 'price opinion'?",
    a: "A price opinion is a single number — what a real buyer says they'd genuinely pay for the property. It's anonymous, takes seconds to submit, and is aggregated with other opinions to form a clear, evidence-based picture of where the market sits.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I really not need photography?',
    a: "Not to start. You can run a Premarket campaign with just a couple of basic phone photos and a guide price. The goal is to gather buyer evidence first — once the data tells you the price is right, you commission proper marketing with confidence.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How do buyers find premarket properties?',
    a: 'Buyers create a free account, follow their suburbs, and get notified the moment new properties — including premarket exclusives — match their criteria. Email, push notification, and an in-app feed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Premarket available across Australia?',
    a: 'Yes. Premarket runs nationally, with active campaigns in every state and territory.',
  },
