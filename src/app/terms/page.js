                                Premarket is designed to support early-stage property discovery and interest validation by connecting homeowners, buyers, and agents through a neutral, technology-driven interface. The Platform is not intended to replace formal real estate processes, nor does it act as an agent or intermediary in any property transaction.
                            </p>

                                    Homeowners can create a campaign to test buyer interest before formally going to market. You may upload images, provide property details, set price expectations, and interact with potential buyers. You remain in full control of your campaign at all times and are under no obligation to sell, respond, or negotiate with any party.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You must ensure that any property you list is owned by you, or that you have appropriate authority to list and manage the campaign on behalf of the owner. You must also ensure the information you provide is accurate and not misleading.
                                </p>

                                    Buyers can browse properties, express interest, save favourites, and submit informal offers through the Platform. All interactions are exploratory and non-binding. Expressing interest in a property does not constitute a formal offer or contractual obligation.

Agents are not employed or contracted by Premarket and must hold valid real estate licenses as required by their jurisdiction.

                                Premarket may refer or connect users to third-party service providers, including but not limited to conveyancers, mortgage brokers, building inspectors, agents, removalists, or document specialists. These referrals are provided for user convenience and do not constitute an endorsement, recommendation, or guarantee of service quality or availability.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                These third parties operate independently of Premarket. Any interactions, transactions, or engagements between you and a referred third-party provider are conducted entirely at your own risk and discretion. You are responsible for reviewing their terms, verifying credentials, and making any necessary inquiries before proceeding.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Premarket does not control, supervise, or warrant the services, accuracy, pricing, reliability, legality, or conduct of any third-party provider. We accept no responsibility for any acts, omissions, damages, losses, or disputes that arise out of your engagement with third-party services.

                                From time to time, Premarket may receive commissions, referral fees, or other forms of compensation from third-party providers in connection with services referred through the Platform. By using these services, you acknowledge and consent to this potential commercial relationship.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You agree that any issues, disputes, or claims relating to third-party services must be addressed directly with the provider in question. Premarket will not act as an intermediary, negotiator, or dispute resolution body between users and third-party vendors.
