Premarket – Agent-Only Homepage Brief

Objective:
Create a single-page, sales-driven homepage that positions Premarket as the only serious pre-market platform built purely for agents.
No pricing. No distractions. One goal: book a demo / sales call.

This page must be:

Instantly understandable (5-second rule)

Emotionally resonant with real agents

Visually modern, powerful, and smooth

Focused on value-first selling, not selling homes early

Built to convert skeptical, experienced agents

1. Positioning & Core Message
Who this is for

Residential real estate agents

Principals & high-performing agents

Agents already talking about pre-market, but doing it badly, manually, or inconsistently

Who this is NOT for

Vendors

Buyers

DIY landlords

Price shoppers

This is an internal agent weapon, not a public marketplace.

2. The Core Problem (Agent Reality)

Agents already offer “pre-market” — but:

There is no system

No structure

No credibility

No consistent buyer feedback

No proof to show vendors

No leverage in listing conversations

The pain we must surface clearly:

Awkward marketing spend conversations ($2k–$5k scares vendors early)

Fatigue from mind changes

Endless back-and-forth before authority is built

Vendors shopping agents instead of committing

Agents doing free work with no edge

3. Premarket’s Solution (Reframed Correctly)

Premarket is NOT about selling early.
It’s about giving value earlier — when the vendor is still deciding.

Premarket allows agents to:

Add prospect properties before or at the first meeting

Run a free pre-market campaign

Release the property to a real buyer network

Collect:

Price opinions

Registered interest

Buyer signals

Walk back into the vendor conversation with:

Data

Proof

Momentum

Authority

Result:

Trust built earlier

Easier commitment

Less resistance

Stronger listing position

Optional early sale (not the goal, but a bonus)

4. Sales Framework to Use (IMPORTANT)

Use a Value-First / Authority-Based Sales Framework:

Relatable problem

Reframe the belief

Demonstrate value

Reduce perceived effort

Social proof

Guarantee

Clear next step (demo)

Every section must earn the scroll.

5. Page Structure (Single Page Only)
HERO SECTION (Above the Fold)

Goal:
Make agents say: “Fuck… this is exactly my problem.”

Headline (example tone – refine aggressively):

Stop Asking Vendors for Marketing Money Before You’ve Earned Their Trust

Subheadline:

Premarket lets you offer a free pre-market campaign that builds trust, gathers real buyer feedback, and helps you win listings earlier — with almost no extra work.

Primary CTA:

“Book a Demo”

Large, high-contrast

Sticky as user scrolls

Visual:

Light theme

Brave-style orange + purple accents

Smooth motion.dev animations

Subtle UI demo loop (price opinion slider + registered interest form)

PROBLEM / AGITATION SECTION

Header:

Most Agents Talk About Premarket. Almost None Do It Well.

Bullets / short punch lines:

No structure

No proof

No leverage

Same pitch, same outcome

Reinforce:

Vendors don’t say no to you

They say no to risk and uncertainty

SOLUTION OVERVIEW

Header:

Premarket Is the System Your Premarket Conversations Have Been Missing

Short explanation:

Add a property in seconds

Share it privately with real buyers

Collect price opinions & interest

Walk back into the conversation with data

UI Demo (motion.dev):

Animated price opinion slider

Smooth registered interest form

Minimal, clean, powerful

This is NOT a full app tour.
It’s a confidence demo.

HOW IT WORKS (Simple, Clean)

Header:

How Agents Use Premarket to Win Listings Earlier

Steps:

Add the property before or at your first meeting

Offer a free pre-market campaign (instead of asking for marketing spend)

Buyers submit price opinions & interest

You return with proof, not promises

Vendor commits with confidence

Reinforce:

This isn’t more work. It replaces work you already hate doing.

REFRAME SECTION (Very Important)

Header:

Premarket Isn’t About Selling Early — It’s About Building Trust Earlier

Copy points:

You’re not pushing the vendor

You’re not discounting your service

You’re not gambling on marketing spend

You’re giving value first

Optional callout:

Many agents do sell during pre-market — but that’s the upside, not the pitch.

TESTIMONIALS (Social Proof)

Two video testimonial slots

Real agents

Talking about:

Easier conversations

Winning listings

Less resistance

Better vendors

Below videos:

Short written testimonials

Emphasise outcomes, not features

GUARANTEE SECTION (Bold)

Header:

Guaranteed to Add Value — Or You Don’t Pay

Copy:

We believe so strongly in this

That we offer a success guarantee

Speak to our team to understand how it works

This removes risk and invites conversation.

FINAL CTA (Close Strong)

Header:

Let Us Show You How This Works — Properly

CTA:

Book a Demo

One action

No pricing

No signup

No friction

Reinforce:

See it live. Ask questions. Decide after.

FOOTER (Minimal)

No distractions

6. Design & UX Direction

Light theme

Brave / ING-style confidence

Generous spacing

Smooth micro-interactions

motion.dev for:

Sliders

7. Technical Notes (for Claude Dev Agents)

Single page

No routing

Use existing propertyPageClient.js assets as inspiration only

Simplify everything

Motion > complexity

Focus on perceived power, not feature depth

8. Success Criteria

The homepage is successful if:

An agent understands Premarket in under 10 seconds

They feel relief, not pressure

They believe it gives them an edge

They book a demo without asking for price
